We present radiative transfer models of the circumstellar environment
of classical T Tauri stars, concentrating on the formation of the
H-alpha emission. The wide variety of line profiles seen in
observations are indicative of both inflow and outflow, and we
therefore employ a circumstellar structure that includes both
magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind.  We perform systematic
investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the
magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical
conditions which lead to the types of profiles seen in
observations. We find that the hybrid models can reproduce the wide
range of profile types seen in observations, and that the most common
profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter
space. Conversely, the most infrequently observed profile morphologies
require a very specific set of models parameters.  We find our model
profiles are consistent with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate
to mass-accretion rate ratio (mu=0.1) found in earlier
magneto-hydrodynamic calculations and observations, but the models
with 0.05<mu<0.2 are still in accord with observed H-alpha profiles.
We investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a function
of model parameters, and examine the reliability of H-alpha as a mass
accretion diagnostic.  Finally, we examine the H-alpha spectroscopic
classification used by Reipurth et. al, and discuss the basic physical
conditions that are required to reproduce the profiles in each
classified type.
