 the wide variety of emission line profiles seen in observations.
 To overcome the limited applicability of the radiative transfer models

 profiles, and to any other lines affected by the stellar wind) presented,
 two types of kinematic wind models are introduced: (1)\SpecialChar ~
the bipolar wind
 model in which the wind is originated from the star itself, and (2)\SpecialChar ~
the
 disc-wind model in which the wind originates from the inner part of the
 accretion disc.
 We perform systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind
 and the magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical condition
s which lead to the types of the profiles seen in observations.
 We find both wind models can reproduce the wide range profile types seen
 is observations.
 We also find the inclination dependency of the line equivalent width predicted
 by the bipolar wind model agree with trends seen in the observation, but
 the disc-wind model does not.
 Using the model results, we examine the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 spectroscopic classification used by Reipurth et.\SpecialChar ~
al , and discuss the basic
 physical conditions required to reproduce the profiles in each classified
 type.
 Using the hybrid model, we fit the observed H

 from the optical component of T\SpecialChar ~
Tau triple system (T\SpecialChar ~

 Classical T\SpecialChar ~
Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit strong H

 Some of the most active CTTS show emission in higher Balmer lines and metal
 lines (e.g.,

 They also exhibit an excess amount of continuum flux in the ultraviolet
 (UV) and infrared (IR).
 Their spectral energy distribution and polarisation data suggest the presence
 of a circumstellar disc, and it plays an important role in regulating dynamics
 of gas flows around CTTS.

\layout Standard

In a currently favoured model of accretion flows around CTTS, the accretion
 discs are disrupted by the magnetosphere of stars which channels the gas
 from the disc onto the surface of the stars (e.g., 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{uchida:1985}
\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{shu:1994}
\end_inset 

).
 This picture of the accretion flows is supported by the evidences that
 CTTS have relatively strong (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{3}\mathrm{G}$
\end_inset 

) magnetic field (e.g., 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt*{jonhs-krull:1999}
\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{guenther:1996}
\end_inset 

) and by the radiative transfer models which reproduce the observed profiles
 for some TTS (
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{muzerolle:2001}
\end_inset 

).
 The magnetospherical accretion model naturally explains the blue-ward asymmetri
c emission lines (seen in some of CTTS) caused by the partial occultation
 of the flow by the disc, and the redshifted absorption component at the
 typical free-fall velocities (a few hundred 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

) seen in some of CTTS.
 Despite the success of the magnetospherical accretion model in explaining
 the line profiles in some CTTS, the overwhelming observational evidences
 for the outflow (mentioned above) in the CTTS profiles suggests that this
 model is only a part of a whole picture.
 Clearly, the modification to include the out-flowing wind/jet flow is necessary
 if one requires to predict the mass-accretion rate and the mass-loss rate
 of CTTS by modelling their emission profiles (e.g.
 H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

).

Priory to the magnetospherical models, many alternative models had been
 considered to explain the observed spectroscopic features mentioned earlier.

 model (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

chromospheric model (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{kwan:1995}
\end_inset 

).
 Considering the success of the magnetospherical accretion flow model in
 some cases and the observational evidences for the outflows, it is likely
 that an improved spectroscopic model requires both inflow and outflow component
s.
 The combination of the magnetospheric accretion flow model with model 1
 or 4 would be a reasonable starting point.
 Although time consuming to explore a larger parameter space, more realistic
 density, velocity and temperature structure from magnetohydrodynamic wind+accre
tion models should be considered as inputs for an radiative transfer model
 in the future.

The main aim of this paper is to find a simple kinematic model which can
 reproduce the wide variety of the observed profiles, and to perform the
 empirical studies of the line formation.
 More specifically, we present disc--wind--magnetosphere hybrid models for

 This study should provide preliminary physical conditions which lead to
 the wide variety of emission line profiles seen in the observation, and
 would help to construct more comprehensive circumstellar models (e.g.
 via MHD simulations) of T\SpecialChar ~

 In all regions, the density is symmetric around the z-axis.

 From the inner most part of the accretion disc, the gas freely fall, moving

 For the purpose of computational simplicity, the collimated bipolar wind
 are defined only in the outside of the largest radius of the magnetosphere
 (to avoid overlapping of the wind with the magnetosphere).

 For simplicity, the free-falling kinetic energy is assumed to be thermalized
 in the radiating layer, and re-emits as blackbody radiation (with a single
 temperature).
 With the parameters of the magnetosphere and the star given above (Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $8$

\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent of the surface is covered by the hot rings, and its temperature
 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $6400\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

.
 If the mass-accretion rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

, the ratio of this accretion luminosity to the photospheric luminosity
 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 The continuum emission from the hot rings is taken into account when computing
 the line profiles.

 The magnetic field is assumed to be so strong that the gas flow does not

 As shown in Fig.\SpecialChar ~

 In our models,

\layout Standard

Similar to the simple wind model of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{appenzeller:2005}
\end_inset 

, the following parametrisation of collimated bipolar wind (region 3 in
 Fig.\SpecialChar ~

 The wind velocity field,

, is consist of radial and azimuthal components which depend on the spherical
 coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

.
 The radial component 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{r}\left(r\right)$
\end_inset 

 is assumed to be in the classical beta-velocity law 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep[c.f.][]{castor:1979}
\end_inset 

, and the azimuthal component 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\phi}$
\end_inset 

 is assumed to be a constant fraction (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

) of the Keplerian velocity for a given distance (
\begin_inset Formula $w=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
\end_inset 

) from the symmetry axis (
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-axis) , i.e.:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{wind}} & = & v_{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}}+v_{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{\bphi}}\label{eq:wind_velocity_def}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v_{r}\left(r\right)=v_{r0}+\left(v_{\infty}-v_{r0}\right)\left(1-\frac{R_{\mathrm{mo}}}{r}\right)^{\beta}\,,\label{eq:wind_velocity_radial_part}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v_{\phi}\left(w\right)=\gamma\,\left(\frac{GM_{*}}{w}\right)^{1/2}\,,\label{eq:wind_velocity_azimuth_part}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

Note that the base of the wind starts at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=R_{\mathrm{mo}}$
\end_inset 

.
 This is chosen so mainly for computational simplicity i.e.
 to avoid the overlap between the wind and the magnetosphere; however, see
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{matt:2005}
\end_inset 

 for the possibility that wind originates from the stellar surface (restricted
 near the polar caps).
 The range of the polar angle for the wind is restricted to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>\left|\theta_{\mathrm{disc}}\right|$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{disc}}$
\end_inset 

 is the opening angle of the accretion disc, to avoid the overlap.
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{r0}$
\end_inset 

is the small radial velocity at the base of the wind (
\begin_inset Formula $r=R_{\mathrm{mo}}$
\end_inset 

).
 Normally, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{r0}=10\,\mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

 which is approximately equal to the thermal velocity of hydrogen with 
\begin_inset Formula $T=7500\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

.
 Following

status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{appenzeller:2005}
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.05$
\end_inset 

 is adopted.
 The dependency of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{r}$
\end_inset 

 in polar direction (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0$
\end_inset 

) on the values of wind acceleration parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 is shown in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:wind_vr_rho}

\end_inset 

.
 All other parameters describing the wind are fixed as the standard values
 given in Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:std_parameters}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Further, the density of the wind is assumed to be axi-symmetric and separable
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

 for computational simplicity, i.e., 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho\left(r,\theta\right)=P\left(r\right)\, F\left(\theta\right)\label{eq:wind_density_def}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F\left(\theta\right)=n\,\cos^{b}\theta\label{eq:wind_density_theta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 is normally positive even number (for the density symmetric about the equatoria
l plane), and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is the angular normalisation constant.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset 

, the wind is spherically symmetric except for the parts disrupted by the
 accretion disc.
 The larger the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, the higher the degree of the collimation.
 By integrating equation\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:wind_density_theta}

\end_inset 

 over angles and normalising the integral to 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$
\end_inset 

, one finds 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
n=\frac{1+b}{1-\cos^{1+b}\theta_{\mathrm{wind}}}\,.\label{eq:wind_density_theta_norm}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Assuming the total mass-loss rate by the wind/jet is 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 and the mass-flux conserves in time, the radial part of the density function
 is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(r\right)=\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}\,\left[4\pi r^{2}v_{r}\left(r\right)\right]^{-1}$
\end_inset 

; hence, Equation\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:wind_density_def}

\end_inset 

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho\left(r,\theta\right)=\frac{n\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}\,\cos^{b}\theta}{4\pi r^{2}\, v_{r}\left(r\right)}\,.\label{eq:wind_density_final}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For a given mass-accretion rate, the wind mass-loss rate in our typical
 model is assigned from the ratio of mass-loss to mass-accretion rate (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}\approx0.1$
\end_inset 

), indicated by both observations and MHD calculations (e.g.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{koenigl:2000}
\end_inset 

).
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:wind_vr_rho}

\end_inset 

 shows the density along a streamline in the polar direction (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0$
\end_inset 

), for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 with all other parameters fixed as the standard values (Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:std_parameters}

\end_inset 

).
 The density is relatively sensitive to the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $r<10\, R_{\mathrm{mo}}$
\end_inset 

, but a little difference is seen beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $r<100\, R_{\mathrm{mo}}$

The local mass-loss rate per unit area (

 and is a function of the cylindrical radius 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{1/2}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\dot{m}\left(w\right)\propto T\left(w\right)^{\alpha}\,\,.\label{eq:discwind-massloss-temp}\end{equation}

 Further, the mid-plane temperature of the disc is assumed to be expressed
 as a power-law in

The computation of the H

the source function calculation (

the observed flux/profile calculation.
 In the first process, we have utilised the method by

To compute the observed line profile, the Monte Carlo radiative transfer
 method (e.g.
 
\begin_inset ERT

) using the Sobolev escape-probability can be used when (1)\SpecialChar ~
a large velocity

the intrinsic line width is
 negligible compared to the Doppler broadening of the line.
 In our earlier models (

 However, as noted and demonstrated by

 First, the emission and absorption profiles must be replaced by a Voigt

 The damping constant

 In terms of level populations and the Voigt profile, the line opacity for

 We specify the cylindrical coordinates

 The observed flux (

 For a given ray along

 The initial position of each ray is assigned to be at the centre of the
 surface element (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{d}A=p\,\sin q\,\mathrm{d}q\,\mathrm{dp}$

 The code execution time is proportional to

The optical depth

 is the opacity of media the ray passes through.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 (or to the outer boundary closer to the observer).
 Initially, the optical depth segments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{d\tau}$
\end_inset 

 are computed at the intersections of a ray with the original AMR grid in
 which the opacity and emissivity information are stored.
 For high optical depth models, additional points are inserted between the
 original points along the ray, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\nu}$
\end_inset 

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{\nu}$
\end_inset 

 values are interpolated to those points to ensure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{d}\tau<0.05$

For a point in the magnetosphere and the wind flows, the emissivity and

 Similarly, for a point in the accretion disc,

 For computational simplicity, we assumed that the dust emissivity is zero.

 The accretion luminosity (

 and

 The results are placed in Figure\SpecialChar ~

 Overall dependency on

 In general, the line strength becomes weaker as the accretion rate and
 the temperature become smaller.
 The red-shifted absorption becomes less visible for higher accretion rate
 and temperature models in which the flux in the damping wings become important.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:broadening}

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:radiative-transfer-model}

 Although the maximum flux of the model with the broadening is almost identical
 to that of the model with no damping constant (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=0$
\end_inset

 seen in the model with broadening.
 A weak red-shifted absorption component (which is a signature of the magnetosph

The dependency of the profile on the inclination angle (

) is demonstrated in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:acc_inclination_effect}

\end_inset

 The model uses the same parameters as in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:broadening}

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 The figure show that the peak (normalised) flux decrease as the inclination
 angle increases.
 Similarly, the equivalent width also decreases as the inclination increases.
 Because of the geometry of the magnetospherical accretion (c.f.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:config_dipolar}

\end_inset 

) and of the presence of the gas with the highest velocity close to the
 stellar surface, the highest red-shifted line-of-sight velocity is visible
 only at the high inclination angles.
 This explains the wider appearance of the profile with 
\begin_inset Formula $i=80^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

compared to the relatively narrow line appearance of the profile with 
\begin_inset Formula $i=10^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 Although not show here, a similar dependency on the inclination angle is

As mentioned in earlier, the magnetospherical accretion flow model alone
 cannot explain some of the features seen in observations.
 As an alternative model, we now examine formation of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 in a simple bipolar wind as described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:wind_jet}

\end_inset 

.
 The basic wind model parameters introduced earlier are 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\infty}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

.
 To minimise the number of parameters to be explored, we initially adopt
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.05$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\infty}=200\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{appenzeller:2005}
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}=10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Further, the angular extent of the wind (the opening angle of the wind)
 is assumed to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathrm{wind}}=80^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

.
 The degree of collimation is initially chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $b=4$
\end_inset 

, i.e.
 the ratio of the density in polar direction to the density at the edge
 of the wind closest to the accretion disc is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\cos0^{\circ}/\cos80^{\circ}\right)^{4}\approx10^{3}$
\end_inset 

, for given radii.
 For simplicity, the wind temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 is assumed to be isothermal\SpecialChar \@.
 Although the line is potentially sensitive
 to the temperature structure of the wind, determination of a self-consistent
 wind temperature is beyond the scope of this paper.

 in which the wind temperature structure is determined by balancing the
 radiative cooling rate (assuming optically thin) with the MHD wave heating
 rate.
 With these parameters kept constant, we examine the characteristics of
 H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles, as a function of the wind acceleration parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and the isothermal wind temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Dependency on the other parameters will be discussed later in this section.
\layout Standard

Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_wind_model}

\end_inset 

 shows the profile computed at a mid inclination angle 
\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

 for the range of the wind temperature between 
\begin_inset Formula $7000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $9000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

, and for the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2.0$
\end_inset 

.
 The P\SpecialChar ~
Cygni profile are prominent in the models with lower values of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 (colder and faster acceleration wind).
 As the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases, the position of the blue-shifted absorption component moves
 toward the line centre.
 which can be seen clearly in the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}=7000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 models.
 While the velocity position of absorption component for the fastest acceleratio
n (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0.2$
\end_inset 

) is almost at the terminal velocity (
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\infty}\sim200\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

), that for the slowest wind acceleration model (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=4.0$
\end_inset 

) is located close the line centre (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim50\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

).
 As one can see in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:wind_vr_rho}

\end_inset 

, the column density of the gas moving at 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 increases as the wind acceleration becomes larger since the gas moving
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 becomes closer to the photosphere.
 At the location where the absorption occurs, the gas is moving faster for
 the models with the faster wind acceleration models; hence, the location
 of the absorption component is bluer as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 becomes smaller (as the wind acceleration faster).
 The figure also shows that the intensity of the emission component increases
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

.
 This is mainly because the density near the photosphere increases (more
 material near the photosphere) as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:wind_vr_rho}

\end_inset 

); hence, the emissivity of increases.
 Unlike the magnetospherical accretion only models (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_acc_models}

\end_inset 

), the inverse P\SpecialChar ~
Cygni profiles are not seen here, nor the blue-ward asymmetry.
 Because of the absorption component in P\SpecialChar ~
Cygni profile, most of the profiles
 show red-ward asymmetry except for the low temperature wind models with
 high inclinations (not shown here).
\layout Standard

The dependency of the profile on the wind anisotropy parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 is demonstrated in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_wind_b_param}

\end_inset 

.
 Three models presented in the figure have the same mass-loss (
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

), and are computer at inclination angle 
\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

.
 The P\SpecialChar ~
Cygni profile feature becomes more prominent, and the line flux becomes
 smaller as the wind becomes more isotropic (smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 value).
 For a fixed mass-loss rate, the column density of along the line of a sight
 to the observer at a medium inclination angle (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

) increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 decreases (c.f.\SpecialChar ~
equation\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:wind_density_final}

\end_inset 

); hence, causing more absorption.
 Further more, the value of the highest density in the wind becomes smaller
 for a smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 model.
 As the wind becomes more isotropic, the high gas concentrated more in the
 polar direction has to be spread in the wider angular angles.
 This results in a smaller highest density region in the wind; hence the
 smaller line emissivity.
 For the same reason, the emission in the wings is weaker for the model
 smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 value.
 We also note that the asymmetry around the line centre decreases as the
 wind becomes more isotropic.
 
\layout Standard

The effect of varying the wind mass-loss rate is shown in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_wind_mdot}

\end_inset 

.
 The line is very sensitive to the mass-loss rate.
 With all other parameters fixed constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 acts as an scaling factor of the wind density (equation\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:wind_density_final}

\end_inset 

).
 For the formation of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

, the recombination process and the subsequent downward transition to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset 

 level.
 Assuming the ionisation fraction remains constant, the recombination rate
 is proportional to the square of wind density.
 We have found the line flux of the models in the figure is approximately
 proportional to the square of the mass-loss rate.
 This very sensitive nature of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 would make the line a good candidate for a mass-loss rate indicator; however,
 without solving the ambiguity of the emission component from the magnetospheric
al accretion flow and the wind, and without knowing the detailed temperature
 structure of the wind, it could provide us a misleading a mass-loss rate
 estimate of a T Tauri star.

Next, we examine the effect of the size of the inner radius of the disc
 and the distribution of the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 emission region.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_alpha_disc}

\end_inset 

 shows the wind emission profiles computed with and without the accretion
 disc at 
\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

.
 The H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 images (projected on to the plane perpendicular to the observer at the
 location of the star) are also shown in the same figure.
 Both models use the same parameters as in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_wind_model}

\end_inset 

, but with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0.5$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}=9000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

).
 The model without the disc can be also considered as a model with a large
 inner radius of the accretion disc, in which none of the wind emission
 region is blocked by the disc --- provided the inclination angle is not
 so high and the disc is not or slightly flared.
\layout Standard

The bipolar nature of the wind is clearly seen in the images.
 In this example, the most of the wind emission occurs within a few to a
 several (depending mainly on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

) stellar radii from the star.
 The figure also shows that the accretion disc blocking the wind emission
 from the bottom half of the wind which is moving away from the observer.
 This results in the reduction of the wind emission in the red wing.
 The image (mid panel) also shows that the accretion disc is not occulting
 the stellar disc at this inclination; therefore, the ratio of the wind
 emission flux to the photospherical continuum flux becomes slightly smaller
 for the model with the disc.
 This results in the reduction in the peak flux and the flux in the wings
 in the normalised profile shape.
 If the disc becomes more flared (if the opening angle exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

at the outer edge of the accretion disc), the occultation of the stellar
 disc by the accretion could be seen at this inclination angle.
 Although it is not shown here, the continuum level of the two models are
 identical.
 For the models with 
\begin_inset Formula $i<30^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

, the presence of the disc has little/no effect on the profile shapes.
 In the figures, the extent of the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 emission is smaller (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.2\,\mathrm{AU}$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim20\, R_{*}$
\end_inset

 the outflows of larger scale (

\end_inset 

) is the emission region become slightly larger (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.4$

\layout Standard

Although not shown here, we have computed the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles with the collimated wind and the accretion disc for the same range
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}$
\end_inset 

values as in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_wind_model}

\end_inset 

.
 The inner and the outer radii of the accretion disc are 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mathrm{di}}=R_{\mathrm{mi}}=2.2R_{*}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,\mathrm{AU}$
\end_inset 

 respectively, and the disc is slightly flared (see section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Accretion-disc}

\end_inset 

).
 Similar to the case in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_alpha_disc}

\end_inset 

, the line flux of the models with accretion disc decreases to less than
 the half of that without the accretion disc similar to the models shown
 in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_alpha_disc}

\end_inset 

.
 The overall behaviour of the line profile shapes as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 are very similar to that for the models without the accretion disc.
 A significant reduction of the flux in the red wing is seen in the wind
 model with the accretion disc when compared with the wind only model.
 The wings appear to be weaker in these models compared to the wind only
 models because of the lower wind emission flux to the continuum flux as
 briefly mentioned earlier.

We examine the characteristics of the line profiles arising from the combination
 of the magnetospherical accretion flow, the wind, and the accretion disc.
 For simplicity, the parameters for the magnetosphere (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}=7500\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

 are fixed as in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_acc_models}

\end_inset 

), and the wind mass-loss rate, the isothermal wind temperature and the
 wind anisotropy parameter to 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}=10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

 (i.e.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}=0.1\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$
\end_inset 

), 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=4$
\end_inset 

 respectively.
 The profile computed for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

 is given in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:summary_beta05_t8000}

\end_inset 

, along with the profile computed with the magnetosphere only and that with
 the wind plus accretion disc configurations for a comparison.
 As one can see from the figure, the profile computed for the disc--wind--magnet
osphere hybrid model can be understood as a simple flux sum of the magnetospheri
cal component and the wind component.
 In this example, the wind causes the absorption of the blue side of the
 profile, and it adds extra flux around the line centre.
 As seen before, the presence of the disc causes the reduction in the red
 side of the profile since the emission from the receding gas is block by
 the disc.
 The resulting profile appears to be narrower than that of the magnetosphere
 model.
 
\layout Standard

The effect of changing the ratio of the wind mass-loss rate to mass-accretion
 rate (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$
\end_inset 

) is demonstrated in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_mdot_disc_wind_acc}

\end_inset 

.
 With the fixed value of mass-accretion rate (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

) , the mass-loss rate by the wind is varied.
 The figure shows that as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 increases the P-Cygni absorption deepens, and the position of minimum flux
 in the absorption trough appears to move blue-ward.
 On the other hand, the emission component becomes stronger as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 increases.
 With this combination of the parameters for the magnetosphere and the wind,
 the absorption component tends to be too strong for the models 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu>0.025$
\end_inset 

 (with this model configuration), at all inclinations (not shown here),
 compared with the observed H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles (e.g.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{alencar:2000}
\end_inset 

).
 As we will see later (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:ttau_model}

\end_inset 

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 can be as large as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.3$
\end_inset 

 with different parameters of the magnetosphere; hence, this condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu>0.025$
\end_inset 

 is always valid.
 
\layout Standard

Again, the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles with the same ranges of the wind temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

) and the wind acceleration parameter (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

) used in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_only}

\end_inset 

 are computed with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.01$
\end_inset 

.
 The parameters of the magnetosphere fixed as in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:acc_inclination_effect}

\end_inset 

, are shown in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 along with the model with only the magnetosphere, for a comparison.
 A relatively small value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 is chosen to avoid absorption component of the P-Cyg profile becoming too
 strong, as seen in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_mdot_disc_wind_acc}

\end_inset 

.
 In general, even with small values of the anisotropy parameter (
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset 

), the absorption component is found to be too strong when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.1$
\end_inset 

 is used with this combination of the magnetosphere and the wind.
 The figure shows that the position of the wind absorption component moves
 toward the line centre as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 becomes larger.
 Although little wind emission is seen in this temperature range, it becomes
 more important in a model with a higher temperature and a wind mass-loss
 rate.
 In fact, the model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2.0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{dw}}=9000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 displays a small amount of the wind emission at 
\begin_inset Formula $V\sim50\,\mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

As seen in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:summary_beta05_t8000}

\end_inset 

, the profiles shown here can be understood as the combination of the emission
 from the magnetosphere and the absorption of the flux by the wind component.
 In general, the emission from the accretion disc is negligible at H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 wavelength, but the absorption of the continuum flux from the photosphere
 by the disc is important for predicting correct line strengths.
\layout Standard

Although the profiles shown in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 are those at a single inclination angle (
\begin_inset Formula $i=55^{\circ}$

 The main difference between the two models are in their density structure.
 For a given radius, the density increases toward the polar direction in
 the former model, but the density increases toward the equatorial plane
 for the models presented here.

First, the disc wind models without the magnetosphere are considered.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_only}

\end_inset 

 shows the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles computed using only the disc-wind component (c.f.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:config_discwind}

\end_inset 

) for the same isothermal disc-wind temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{dw}}$
\end_inset 

) and the wind acceleration parameter (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

) ranges used for the bipolar wind models.
 The parameters used for the central star are as in section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Continuum-Source}

\end_inset 

, and the other disc-wind parameters are summarised in Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:std_discwind_parameters}

\end_inset 

.
 The figure shows that the wind emission increases 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{dw}}$
\end_inset 

 increase.
 Similar to the bipolar wind models, the location of the P-Cyg absorption
 component moves toward the line centre as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases.
 The morphology of the profile exhibited by the model changes from FU-Ori
 type (IV-B) for the models with small 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 to III-B and II-B types (
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

) as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases.
 Although not shown here, we find that the profile shapes are relatively
 insensitive to the value of the wind collimation parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset 

.
 The dependency on the disc wind mass-loss rate of the profile shape is
 similar to that of the collimated wind models (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_mdot_disc_wind_acc}

\end_inset 

) .
\layout Standard

We now consider the models computed with the combination of the disc-wind
 and the magnetospherical accretion components.
 The parameters used for the magnetosphere are set to be same as in the
 case for Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:acc_inclination_effect}

\end_inset 

, and are kept constant for simplicity.
 The mass-loss rate of the disc wind is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{dw}}=10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

 (i.e.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\dot{M}_{\mathrm{dw}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=0.1$
\end_inset 

) Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 shows the models profiles computed using the same ranges of the disc-wind
 temperature and the wind acceleration parameter as in the previous cases.
 
\layout Standard

As in the disc wind only models (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_only}

\end_inset 

), the location of the absorption component moves toward the line centre
 as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 increases (as the wind acceleration slower).
 The figure shows that in the models with smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{dw}}$
\end_inset 

, the line emission from the magnetosphere dominates.
 On the other hand, in the models with larger 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{dw}}$
\end_inset 

, the emission from the disc wind dominates.

 profiles (
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

citealt{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

).
 The shape of the primary and secondary peaks in the profiles are slightly
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

rounder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 compared to those of the accretion, collimated wind, disc hybrid model
 shown in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

.
 The rounder peaks are caused by the rotation of the wind.
 The profiles from the disc wind models are affected more by the rotational
 motion of the wind since the gas is more concentrated toward the equator,
 but in the models with the collimated wind the gas is concentrated more
 in the polar directions.
\layout Standard

We note the ambiguity seen between some of the disc-wind only models and
 the disc-wind, magnetosphere hybrid models.
 For example, the disc-wind only model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(T_{\mathrm{wind}},\,\beta\right)=\left(8000\,\mathrm{K},\,1.0\right)$
\end_inset 

 in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_only}

\end_inset 

 and the disc-wind model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(T_{\mathrm{wind}},\,\beta\right)=\left(9000\,\mathrm{K},\,0.5\right)$
\end_inset 

 in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 give very similar profiles.
 Given such an observed profile, it is difficult to distinguish if the emission
 is dominated by the accretion or the wind unless some other lines, not
 affected associated with wind or magnetosphere, are used simultaneously.
 
\layout Standard

General characteristics of the profiles from the disc-wind, magnetosphere
 hybrid model (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

) are very similar to those of the disc, collimated wind, magnetosphere
 hybrid model (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

).
 The main difference between these two sets of models is the mass-loss rate
 to the mass accretion rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

.
 While the models presented in this section use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.1$
\end_inset 

 which is consistent with the MHD jet models (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset ERT

citealt{koenigl:2000}
\end_inset 

), the models in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 use much smaller value (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.01$
\end_inset 

).

 proposed the two-dimensional classification of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 emission profiles of T\SpecialChar ~
Tauri stars and Herbig Ae/Be stars.
 Their classification scheme contains four classes (I, II, III and IV) different
iated by the ratio of the secondary-to-primary emission components in the
 profiles.
 Each classes are divided into two sub-classes (B and R) which depends whether
 the absorption component is on the blue or red side.
 Readers are refereed to Fig.\SpecialChar ~
4 of their paper.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

n of 
\begin_inset ERT

citet{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

.
 The combination of the disc wind, magnetospherical accretion, and accretion
 disc can reasonably reproduce all the classes of the profiles seen in observati
ons.
 Similar profiles can be reproduced if the bipolar wind is used instead
 of the disc wind, but the wind absorption at a given velocity location
 occurs at a different inclination angles when the wind type is switched
 from the bipolar wind to the disc wind.
 The corresponding model parameters used to reproduce the profiles in the
 figure are given in Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:classification}

\end_inset 

 along with brief comments on possible physical conditions which leads to
 the profiles in each class.
 
\layout Standard

Using the samples of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 from 43 CTTS, 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

 found the most common (33\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) type of the profile is Type III-B.
 Interestingly, the most common profile type seen in the profiles from both
 the bipolar wind, disc and magnetosphere hybrid model (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

) and the disc-wind and the magnetosphere hybrid model (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

) are Type III-B profiles.
 In this type of profiles, the main emission comes from the magnetosphere,
 and the profile shape is altered a slightly blue-asymmetric one to a slightly
 red-asymmetric one via the wind absorption in the blue wing.
 The second most common profile (26\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) 
\layout Standard

Type I (symmetric around line centres) is mainly produced in the magnetosphere.
 Although not shown here, this type of profile can be reproduced with the
 disc-wind, magnetosphere hybrid mode with pole on configuration.
 Since there is not material in the polar region in the disc wind model,
 the observer can look the magnetosphere almost directory for high inclination
 cases, provided that wind temperature is low enough so that the wind emission
 is negligible.
 Type II-R and Type II-B can be produced in a similar physical conditions
 (e.g.
 in a slow accretion and low temperature wind plus a magnetosphere).
 Main difference is between the two is in their inclination angles.
 The former is more likely seen with high inclination.
\layout Standard

Type III-R is the least common type of the observed profile (2\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) according
 to 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

.
 Incidentally, we also had a hard time to reproduce this type of profile
 since this can be achieve only at narrow range of parameter space (very
 high inclination angle with disc wind model, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}\sim8300\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}~10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Standard

Similarly the Type IV-R is the second least common type of observed profile
 (5\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) which shows the inverse P-Cyg profile shape.
 This can be understood since the magnetospherical accretion model of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{hartmann:1994}
\end_inset 

 predicts that the redshifted absorption can occur at a limited range of
 inclination angle with which the hot continuum flux from the footprint
 of the magnetosphere is seen through relatively fast moving gas in the
 accretion stream.
 Finally Type III-R profile is very similar to Type II-R, but the wind in
 this type of profile may be accretion faster than that in Type II-R.

For the photospheric model, the following parameters from

status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{calvet:2004}
\end_inset 

 are adopted: 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=5500\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{*}=1.9\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{*}=2.9\, R_{*}$

 The standard geometry for the magnetosphere (
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mathrm{mi}}=2.2\, R_{*}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mathrm{mo}}=3.0\, R_{*}$
\end_inset 

) and the bipolar wind configuration (Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:std_parameters}

\end_inset 

) are used for simplicity.
 Again, our purpose here is not to obtain the best fit parameters, but rather
 it is to examine if the model is capable of reasonably reproducing the
 data from a real object, in this case, T\SpecialChar ~
Tau\SpecialChar ~
N.
 The main parameters here (1)\SpecialChar ~
the temperature of the magnetospherical accretion

\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}$

), (2)\SpecialChar ~
the mass-accretion rate (

Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:ttau_model}

\end_inset 

 shows the result of a model fit.
 The amount of veiling near H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 is very small (
\begin_inset Formula $<0.01$
\end_inset 

) for T\SpecialChar ~
Tau, according to 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{basri:1990}
\end_inset 

; hence, the observation is not corrected for veiling.
 The model consists of the magnetosphere, the bipolar wind, and the accretion
 disc (with a large hole i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5$\, AU

\end_inset 

.
 The parameters used for the model fit are: 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}=22000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}=8000\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=1.1\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}=2.0\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 The temperature of the magentosphere is relatively high compared to the
 standard cases (e.g.\SpecialChar ~
Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_acc_models}

\end_inset 

; also 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{muzerolle:2001}
\end_inset 

).
 Note that the estimated value of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}$
\end_inset 

depends on the adopted values of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{*}$
\end_inset 

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{*}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$
\end_inset 

) for the photospheric continuum model.
 If a lower value of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{*}$
\end_inset 

 is adopted, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}$
\end_inset 

value would become smaller in order to match the line strength which is
 mainly determined by the emission from the magnetosphere, in this case.
 For example, if the photospheric continuum is 3 times smaller than the
 one used here, one finds 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}\sim9600\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 which is more similar to that of the standard cases.
 The figure shows that the agreement between the model and the observation
 is quite reasonable although the line wings are slightly stronger in the
 models.
 In this example, the main profile feature is defined by the emission from
 the magnetosphere, but the blue side of the profile is affected by the
 absorption by the wind.
 The mass-loss to mass-accretion rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.18$
\end_inset 

 which is similar to the value predicted by observations and MHD simulations
 i.e.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.1$
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{koenigl:2000}
\end_inset 

.
 Compared our mass-accretion rate estimate is much less than that of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{johns-krull:2000}
\end_inset 

, and slightly smaller than that of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{calvet:2004}
\end_inset 

 (see above).
 
\layout Standard

Although not shown here for clarity, the peak flux near the line centre
 is also affected by the wind absorption (causing about 10 per cent reduction)
 compared to the profile computer with magnetosphere only model (similar
 effect also seen in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

).
 If the fit was performed by ignoring the wind, the temperature and the
 mass-accretion rate of the magnetospherical accretion flow will be underestimat
ed.
 A better approach to a model fit is a simultaneous fitting of multiple
 lines.
 For example, the near-infrared lines such as Pa
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and Br
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 should be used to determined the mass-loss rate since these lines are much
 less affected by the wind.
 Using the mass-loss rate from these lines, H

Which wind model?
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Which-wind-model}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In the previous sections, two possible geometrical configurations for the
 wind from CTTS were considered: 1.
 the bipolar wind, and 2.\SpecialChar ~
the disc wind.
 While the material more concentrated toward the polar regions for a given
 radius in the first case, the material is more concentrated toward the
 equatorial plane in the second case.
 As mentioned earlier, the bipolar wind morel resembles the density distribution
 of the jet MHD simulation of e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset ERT

\backslash 
citet{krasnopolsky:2003}
\end_inset 

 in large scale (
\begin_inset Formula $>10$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
AU), and the disc wind model resembles that in smaller scale (
\begin_inset Formula $<10$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
AU).
 
\layout Standard

The distinct difference in the density dependency on the polar angles in
 two models should be apparent in the inclination angle dependency on the
 shapes of the line profiles.
 Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_inclination_compare}

\end_inset 

 shows the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles computed for 1.\SpecialChar ~
the disc, bipolar-wind, accretion hybrid model (section
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:model-acc-disc-wind}

\end_inset 

) and 2.\SpecialChar ~
the disc-wind, magnetosphere hybrid model (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:result-discwind-knigge}

\end_inset 

) at inclination angles 
\begin_inset Formula $i=10^{\circ},\,55^{\circ},\,80^{\circ}$
\end_inset 

.
 Both models include the magnetospherical accretion component with the same
 parameters used as in sections\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:model-acc-disc-wind}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:result-discwind-knigge}

\end_inset 

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{max}}=7500\,\mathrm{K}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}=1\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_{\sun}\, yr^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Mainly because of the geometrical configuration, the P-Cyg absorption feature
 weakens as the inclination increases for the model with the bipolar wind.
 The optical depth to an observer is higher (from the wind emission region)
 for with a lower inclination angle with this geometry.
 Although not shown here, this tendency of the inclination dependency holds
 for the models with bipolar wind models for wide ranges of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

.
 For the model with the disc wind, the absorption becomes stronger as the
 inclination becomes larger .
 The optical depth to an observer becomes larger as the inclination increases
 in this geometry.
 
\layout Standard

Similarly, the line equivalent width increases as the inclination angle
 increases for the model with the bipolar wind, it decreases as the inclination
 angle increases for the model with the disc wind.
 With the models with only magnetosphere (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:model-acc}

\end_inset 

), we have also found that the line equivalent width decreases as the inclinatio
n increases in those models (see Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:acc_inclination_effect}

\end_inset 

).
 Interestingly, the observational study of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{appenzeller:2005}
\end_inset 

 showed that the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 line equivalent width of CTTS increases as the inclination angle increases.
 Only the models with the bipolar wind agree with the trend seen in their
 observation.
 Although the uncertainty in the inclination angles of the observed object
 might be large, a larger sample in addition to that of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{appenzeller:2005}
\end_inset 

 for further investigation of the inclination dependency on the line profile
 will be extremely useful for finding a possible wind configuration of CTTS.
\layout Standard

Despite the inclination angle dependency of the observed H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 favouring the models with bipolar wind, there are two main aspects of this
 model are not quite consistent with the magneto-centrifugal launched jet
 numerical models (e.g 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{krasnopolsky:2003}
\end_inset 

).
 First, in section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:model-acc-disc-wind}

\end_inset 

, we found that the ratio of the mass-loss to mass-accretion rates needed
 to be rather small (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\sim0.025$
\end_inset 

), in order not to have an unrealistically strong P-Cyg absorption component,
 compared to the MHD simulations suggested 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{koenigl:2000}
\end_inset 

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\approx0.1$
\end_inset 

.
 In the model fit of T\SpecialChar ~
Tau observation (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:ttau-model}

\end_inset 

), we found much larger value of the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.18$
\end_inset 

.
 Considering large uncertainty in MHD theories and observational measurements
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{wind}}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset 

, ), the wide range of the mass-loss to mass-accretion ratio (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $0.025<\mu<0.18$
\end_inset 

) may be still reasonable.
 On the other hand, the models with the disc wind (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:result-discwind-knigge}

\end_inset 

) using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.1$
\end_inset 

 reproduces the profiles (Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

) similar to that seen in observations.
 Second, the MHD models predict that the wind/jet becomes collimated well
 above the disc plane (
\begin_inset Formula $>10$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
AU), but our bipolar wind model are collimated (density enhanced toward
 in the polar direction) from right outside of the magnetosphere.
 Unless the origin of the wind is from the central star itself, the density
 distribution used for the bipolar wind is not quite consistent with the
 near field of the MHD jet models, considering that the most of the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 emission occurs within a few to a several radii of the magnetosphere (Figure.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:effect_alpha_disc}

\end_inset 

).
 The density structure used for the disc wind model, however, is very similar
 to that of MHD simulations in the near field where the most of the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 wind emission occurs.
 Interestingly, however, the recent study of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{matt:2005}
\end_inset 

 showed the possibility that the stellar wind along the open magnetic field
 originating from the star can cause significant spin-down torque on the
 star, provided that mass-loss rate is high enough.
 Considering the issues mentioned above, it is not possible to favour the
 bipolar wind model to the disc wind model without further observational
 constraints.
 In reality, two types of the winds (bipolar wind and disc wind) may co-exits
 similar to that seen in e.g.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{drew:1998}
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{matt:2005}
\end_inset 

.
 In these models, the fast stellar wind is present in the polar directions,
 and at the same time the slower disc wind is present near the equatorial
 plane.

Conclusions

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Conclusions}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We have presented the disc--wind--magnetosphere hybrid radiative transfer
 models for classical T\SpecialChar ~
Tauri stars, and detailed studies of the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 formation from their complex to circumstellar environment and to understand
 the wide variety emission line profiles seen in observations.
 The two types of wind models considered are (1)\SpecialChar ~
the bipolar wind model in
 the wind is originated from the star itself (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:wind_jet}

\end_inset 

; Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:config_dipolar}

\end_inset 

), and (2)\SpecialChar ~
the disc-wind model in which the wind originates from the inner
 part of the accretion disc (section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Alternative-model-disc-wind}

\end_inset 

; Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:config_discwind}

\end_inset 

).
 We found that both wind models combined with the magnetospherical accretion
 flow reproduces the wide variety of H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 profiles (Figures\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_disc_wind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:atlas_discwind_acc_model}

\end_inset 

) seen in the observations.
 
\layout Standard

The inclination dependency of the line equivalent width predicted by the
 bipolar wind model agree with trends seen in the observation, but the disc-wind
 model does not.
 With the standard magnetospherical configuration (Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:std_parameters}

\end_inset 

), the ratio of the mass-loss to mass-accretion rates (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

) used in the bipolar wind was set to be 4--10 times smaller than that predicate
d by magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) calculations (c.f.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim0.1;$
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{koenigl:2000}
\end_inset 

) to avoid the blue-shifted absorption component becoming unrealistically
 too strong; however 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 used in the disc-wind models are consistent with MHD calculations.
 
\layout Standard

Using the model results, we examined the H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 spectroscopic classification proposed by 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{reipurth:1996}
\end_inset 

, and discuss the basic physical conditions that reproduce the profiles
 in each classified type.
 Using the hybrid model, we also fit the observed H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 from the optical component of T\SpecialChar ~
Tau triple system (T\SpecialChar ~
Tau\SpecialChar ~
N).
 The agreement between the model and the observation is excellent; however,
 we could not confirm the uniqueness of the fit.
 The ratio of the mass-loss to mass-accretion rate was found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.18$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Although not attempted in this paper, a better approach for determining
 the mass-loss and mass-accretion rate consistently is to model multiples
 lines simultaneously.
 For example, the mass-accretion rate of an object can be determined more
 easily by modelling Pa
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset 

 and Br
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 since there is no/little wind effect seen in these lines.
 The mass-accretion rate then can be used to model H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 to find the wind mass-loss rate.
 
\layout Standard

Similar model configurations used here may be also applicable to Herbig
 Ae/Be and brown dwarfs since their H
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 observations also exhibit evidences of the outflow and inflow (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

;

\backslash 
citealt{muzerolle:2005}
\end_inset 

), but no model has been developed to explain the phenomenon.
 Further investigation on the possibility of applying our model to these
 objects are needed.
 
\layout Standard

Future works should include the followings: (1)\SpecialChar ~
Improving the wind models.
 The parametrisation of the wind density structure should be changed to
 follow more closely that of MHD simulations.
 The wind temperature structure should be calculated self-consistently (c.f.\SpecialChar ~
