Dear Editor(s),


We wish to have our paper titled 

"On the formation of H-alpha line emission around classical T Tauri
stars" (REF#: MN-06-0158-MJ.R1)  

by Ryuichi Kurosawa, Tim J. Harries,  Neil H. Symington 

reconsidered for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

We have made all the corrections that out reviewer suggested. 


 * Please note that we would like to have Figure 11 (fig11.eps)
   reproduced in colour for both paper and web publication.
   In case the colour figure is not possible, I have also submitted an
   alternative version (fig11_grey.eps) in grey-scale.   

Thank you very much,


Ryuichi Kurosawa (rk@astro.ex.ac.uk)
