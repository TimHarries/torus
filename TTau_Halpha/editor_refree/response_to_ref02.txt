Dear Silvia,

Thank your very much for reviewing our paper, and finding many
mistakes in the texts. We are pleased to hear your positive comments on
the paper. We really appreciate your hard work!

I have corrected the typos you found in the main text, and 
the brief responses are listed below. 


Best regards,

Ryuichi Kurosawa, Tim Harries and Neil Symington


================================================================

Sect. 2.2, 3rd paragraph: "The temperature structure of the
magnetospheric used by Hartmann...."  "magnetospheric¨ should be
"magnetosphere".

   * Corrected to "magnetosphere".


Sect. 2.4.1, 1st paragraph: ¨...the disc mass respectively.¨ should be
replaced by ¨...the disc mass respectively, and¨
   
   * Corrected as you pointed out.


Sect. 2.4.1, end of 1st paragraph: "..the outer disk radius (Rdi) is
100 au.¨¨Rdi¨ should be ¨Rdo"

   * Yes.  It should be Rdo. Corrected.

Sect. 4.1, 5th paragraph: after the mass accretion rate value, there
is an extra closing parentheses.

   * Corrected.


Sect. 4.2, end of 5th paragraph: For the wind to be launched
centrifugally according to Blandford & Payne, the field lines must
present Rw > d/tan(60).  With d = 22 Rstar this corresponds to Rw >
12.7 Rstar, instead of 25.4 Rstar as you say in the end of the
paragraph. I had calculated the value of 25.4 Rstar assuming that d =
44 Rstar, as was originally written in this section.

   * Thank you. It should be 12.7 Rstar as you mentined. 
     ==> Corrected.


Sect. 4.2, end of 7th paragraph: "... if the field/stream line is not
straight and bending towards the symmetry axis as the wind travel
higher above the disk.¨I think it reads better with "bends" instead of
"bending"

"travel" should be "travels"

    * Corrected.


Sect. 4.2, end of 8th paragraph: "... we have computed the models with
d= 5 Rstar (not shown here) which satisfies the ..."  Either use "the
model ... which satisfies..." or "models ... which satisfy..."

   * Corrected to "models .. which satisfy..."

Sect. 5.1, end of 1st paragraph: "...which may in some cases induced
by the rotational motion..."  "induced" should be "be induced¨

   * Corrected to "be induced"

Sect. 5.2, caption of Fig. 13: "The wind mass-loss rates used in both
models is Mdot_wind = 10^-8 Msun/yr."  "rates" should be "rate"

   * Corrected.

Appendix A: "...(3) Macc = 10^-9 Msun/yr (Fig. A2)" "A2" should be
"A3"

   * Corrected.
