We present the results of a radial velocity (RV) survey of 14 brown dwarfs

 We obtained high-resolution echelle spectra at the VLT using Ultraviolet
 and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at two different epochs for each
 object, and measured the shifts in their RVs to identify candidates for
 binary/multiple systems in the sample.
 The average time separation of the RV measurements is 21.6\InsetSpace ~

 is sensitive to the binaries with separation

 We found 4 out of 17 objects (or

d time scale,
 and are considered as binary/multiple `candidates.' We found no double-lined
 spectroscopic binaries in our sample, based on the shape of cross-correlation
 curves.
 The RV dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is found to be very similar
 to that of the BD and VLM stars in Chamaeleon\InsetSpace ~

 We also found the distribution of the mean rotational velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$

 of

Most stars are member of binary systems and it is therefore important that
 a complete star formation theory be able to predict the binary fraction,
 period distribution, and mass-ratio distribution of stellar objects across
 a wide range of masses.
 Furthermore, the study of individual binary systems is the only direct
 means to determine fundamental stellar properties such as stellar masses
 and radii.

The extensive imaging surveys provide excellent observational constraints
 on wider BD+BD binaries, but it is now necessary to search for shorter
 period BD+BD binaries systematically.
 Binaries with the separation of less than 1\InsetSpace ~

 imaging techniques, but will be detectable as spectroscopic binaries, providing
 the mass-ratio is not too extreme, and velocity separation is large enough.

 and masses of binaries remains unknown because the follow-up spectroscopic

\begin_layout Standard
The separation distribution of BD/VLM binaries is critical to understanding
 their origin.
 There are two main models for the formation of BDs and VLM stars: first,
 they have low masses because they form in low-mass, dense molecular cloud
 cores (e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citealt{padoan:2002}
\end_layout

\end_inset

); second, BD/VLM objects have low masses because they are ejected from
 the dense core in which they form via dynamical interactions in multiple
 system, cutting off their accretion before they have reached stellar masses
 (
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard

citealt{reipurth:2001}

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citealt*{bate:2002}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Alternatively, there is a third model in which a free-floating BD or planetary-
mass object can be formed in the process of the photo-evaporation (e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citealt{mccaughrean:2002}

\end_inset

;\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard

citealt{whitworth:2004}

\end_inset

) with the outer layers of a pre-stellar core (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.2\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

) removed by the strong radiation pressure from the nearby massive OB stars
 before the accretion onto the protostar at core centre occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the dynamical interaction involved in the second model, BD/VLM binaries
 that survive are generally expected to have small separations.
 In the first model, wider binaries may be expected to be more common.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citet*{bate:2002b}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 suggested that close binaries (
\begin_inset Formula $a<10\,\mathrm{au}$
\end_inset

) do not form directly, but result from hardening of wider systems though
 a combination of dynamical interactions, accretion and interactions with
 circum-binary discs.
 If BD/VLM binaries have formed through such mechanisms, one would not expect
 to find binaries with 1--10\InsetSpace ~
au separations without also finding many with
 separation 
\begin_inset Formula $<1$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
au.
 If an absence/rarity of binaries with 1\InsetSpace ~
au were found, it may support the
 idea that they are ejected quickly from multiple systems before they have
 undergone the interactions that shorten their periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our immediate aim is to identify spectroscopic and close BD/VLM binaries
 using the high-resolution echelle spectroscopy at two epochs.
 This experiment is sensitive to VLM binaries with separations of 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.1$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
au which corresponds to a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10\,\mathrm{d}$
\end_inset

.
 A larger sample of candidates will enable us to measure the binary fraction
 of these short-period/close binaries (once confirmed), and address whether
 there is a significant population of 'hidden' VLM companions.
 The long term goal of this project to follow up the binary candidates found
 in this paper by spectroscopically monitoring them over different time
 scales, enabling us to obtain the radial velocity curves and their minimum
 masses.

 In summary, the data were corrected for bias, interorder background, sky

 They were then flattened, optimally extracted, and finally the different
 orders were merged.
 No binning was performed to achieve high resolution required for the RV
 measurements.

 However, the autoguiding of the telescope keeps the star at the centre

The radial velocities of each object were determined by using the cross-correlat
ion function of the object spectrum with that of a template star which has
 a similar spectra type.
 By visual inspection, the wavelength ranges used for the cross-correlation
 calculations are chosen by avoiding the regions of spectra affected by
 the telluric lines, and defects and fringes (in near infrared) of the CCDs.
 The radial velocities of objects with respect to the template are obtained
 by measuring the location of the peak in the cross-correlation function.
 The location of the peak is determined by fitting the section of the cross-corr
elation function around the peak by a second order polynomial.
 LHS\InsetSpace ~
49 (Proxima Cen, M5.5) was chosen as the template for this purpose.
 The heliocentric radial velocity of the template object LHS\InsetSpace ~
49 was obtained
 by measuring the wavelength shifts of the prominent photospheric absorption

Before applying the cross-correlation technique to our main targets, we

 In this test, we found the heliocentric 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{RV_{HD\,140538}=}18.18\pm0.62\,\kmps$

 The table also lists the uncertainties in the `relative' radial velocities

 To determine the

add random gaussian deviate noise
 to the object spectra using the corresponding variance spectra, (2)\InsetSpace ~
compute
 the cross-correlation curve using the spectra with added noise and the
 template, (3)\InsetSpace ~
measure the RV by location the peak, (4)\InsetSpace ~
repeat 1--3 for 100
 times, and computes the standard deviation of the 100 RV values.
 This should provide a good estimate of uncertainties in RV cased by the
 uncertainties in the flux levels.

For each object and for each RV measurement, the deviations (

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:radvel01}

 along with their uncertainties (

 Note that in computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathrm{RV}$
\end_inset

 we do not require the knowledge of absolute radial velocities, but only
 the relative velocities (with respect to a template).
 Alternatively, we also computed the cross-correlation functions of spectra
 of a same object (instead of using the spectra of the template LHS\InsetSpace ~
49) from
 two different epochs in order to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathrm{RV}$
\end_inset

 The resulting cross-correlation functions were found to be too noisy (due
 to the relatively low S/N in the object spectra), and the peak positions
 of the cross-correlation curves were not reliably located.

To identify an object with a RV variation with a statistical significance
 from our sample, we apply the method described by 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citet{maxted:2005}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which we briefly summarize next, to our data.
 There are three steps in this method: (1)\InsetSpace ~
compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 by fitting the two-epoch RV data for each object with a constant function
 (a zero-th order polynomial), (2)\InsetSpace ~
compute the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 probability (
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

), (3)\InsetSpace ~
designate the object as a non-constant RV object or a binary candidate
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $p<10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 (1\InsetSpace ~
per\InsetSpace ~
cent).
 When computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

, we use the uncertainties in the relative RV (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset

).
 The number of degree of freedom in the fitting procedure is obviously 1.
 A similar method was also used in a recent RV survey of VLM stars by

\begin_layout Standard
We have computed 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for all the objects, and have plotted the results as a histogram of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log{p}$
\end_inset

, shown in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:chisq-test}

\end_inset

 (excluding the non-member USco\InsetSpace ~
121; see explanation later).
 The figure clearly shows two distinctive populations: one on the left (with
 small 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log{p}$
\end_inset

 values) occupied by the RV constant objects, and one on in the right-most
 bin (with the largest 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log{p}$
\end_inset

) occupied by the RV variable objects which have 
\begin_inset Formula $p<10^{-3}$
\end_inset

.
 The expected distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 computed consistently with our uncertainty measurements is also shown in
 the same figure.
 The RV constant population on the left side reasonably matches the expected
 curve.
 This reassures that our uncertainties in RV values are reasonable, and
 an additional systematic error may not be necessary in this analysis (but
 see Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Binary-fraction}

\end_inset

).
 According to the figure, there are four objects which show significant
 RV variations out of 17 samples.
 They are GY\InsetSpace ~
141, GY\InsetSpace ~
310, USco\InsetSpace ~
55, and USco\InsetSpace ~
104, and considered as our preliminary
 binary/multiple candidates.
 We will discuss the effect of the systematics error in detail, and list
 our final binary/multiple candidates in Section\InsetSpace ~

Next, we investigate the range of semimajor axes of binaries (equivalently
 the range of binary periods) to which our RV survey is sensitive.
 For this purpose, we will consider the detection probability for binaries
 or the RV variables, given the time separations of two-epoch observations
 and the ranges of estimated primary masses (c.f.\InsetSpace ~
Tables\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:literatures}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:summary_results}

 The probability is calculated based on the simulated RV observations of
 binaries whose orbit are randomly selected from a model.
 A similar method was used by

 The most important factors in determining the detection probability are
 the size of uncertainties in RV measurements (which we use the average
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset

 from our observation), and the time separations of observations.
 The smaller the errors in RV measurements, the larger the probability for
 a given binary orbit and a time separation of orbit.
 The larger the time separation of observations, the larger the upper limit
 of the semimajor axis to which an observation is sensitive.
 The average time separation of the two-epoch RV observations of our targets

There are six basic parameters in our Monte Carlo simulation: primary mass

 The primary mass

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:prob_compare}

\end_inset

 along with the probabilities computed without the systematic error (as
 in Section
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Radial-velocities}

\end_inset

).
 The number of objects with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 decreases from 4 to 2 as the systematic error is introduced.
 Unfortunately, the probabilities computed with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{sys}}=0.0\,\kmps$
\end_inset

 for GY\InsetSpace ~
141 and USco\InsetSpace ~
55 are just below the 
\begin_inset Formula $p=10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 boundary value; hence, they become RV constant objects as the systematic
 error is introduced.
 This clearly demonstrates the importance of the uncertainty estimates in
 the measured RV values.
 We found that the histogram of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 probabilities with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{sys}}=0.2\,\kmps$
\end_inset

 (as in Fig\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:chisq-test}

\end_inset

), is also in reasonable agreement with the expected distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log{p}$
\end_inset

 (not shown here).
 The binary fraction estimated with the assumed systematic error is 
\begin_inset Formula $2/17$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f=12_{-8}^{+13}$

An alternative explanation for the RV variations found in the binary candidates
 above is a type of stellar pulsations found by

.
 They studied the non-adiabatic, linear instability of very VLM stars and
 BD during the deturium burning phase in the core, and found unstable fundamenta
l modes in the time-scale between 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5$

\InsetSpace ~
h for the object mass from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\,\Msun$
\end_inset

.
 By using their pulsation periods and by assuming that the pulsation amplitudes
 is 5\InsetSpace ~
per\InsetSpace ~
cent of the radius of the objects, we find that the expected RV
 variation can be 
\begin_inset Formula $>6\,\kmps$
\end_inset

.
 As mentioned in Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:observation-reduction}

\end_inset

, for each object at a given night, two separate spectra are obtained consecutiv
ely (with time separations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.5$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
h.).
 Before co-adding the two spectra together, we have measured the RV from
 each spectrum to check if there is a large jump in the RV measurements
 in short time-scale.
 The shifts in the RV values in measured in the two consecutive spectra
 are found to be between 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02\pm0.10$
\end_inset

 (USco\InsetSpace ~
128) and 
\begin_inset Formula $2.04\pm1.67\,\kmps$
\end_inset

 (USco\InsetSpace ~
66), which is much smaller than the expected RV variation based on
 the models of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented two-epoch RV survey of 18 young BDs and VLM stars (
\begin_inset Formula $0.02~M_{\sun}<M_{*}<0.1~M_{\sun}$
\end_inset

) in UScoOB and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
Oph dark cloud core using the high resolution UVES echelle spectroscopy
 at VLT.
 The average time separation of RV measurements are 21.6\InsetSpace ~
d, and our RV survey
 is sensitive to binaries with separation smaller than 0.1\InsetSpace ~
au.
 One of our targets, USco\InsetSpace ~
121, is most likely a non-member of the UScoOB
 association based on the deviation of the RV from the result of the population
 in the association.
 A similar conclusion was found by 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard

citet{muzerolle:2003}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from their RV study and the low lithium abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found 4 (GY\InsetSpace ~
141, GY\InsetSpace ~
310, USco\InsetSpace ~
55 and USco\InsetSpace ~
104) out of 17 objects as our binary/mu
ltiple candidates.
 This corresponds to the binary fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $24_{-13}^{+16}$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
per\InsetSpace ~
cent for the binary separation 
\begin_inset Formula $a<0.1$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
au.
 We found that the estimated binary fraction is very sensitive to the assumed
 size of systematic error.
 If an additional systematic error of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\,\kmps$
\end_inset

 is added to the uncertainties in the RV measurements, we find only 2 (GY\InsetSpace ~
310
 and USco\InsetSpace ~
104) out of 17 objects as our binary/multiple candidates, which
 corresponds to the binary fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $12_{-10}^{+13}$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
per\InsetSpace ~
cent.

\begin_layout Standard

citet{kraus:2005}

\end_inset

 (which was not known to authors at the time of our observation: April--May,
 2004) confirms that USco\InsetSpace ~
55 and USco\InsetSpace ~
66 are multiple systems, and USco\InsetSpace ~
109
 is most likely a multiple system.
 Their projected separations are 
\begin_inset Formula $a>4.0$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
au which is well above our sensitivity limit of 0.1\InsetSpace ~
au; therefore, it is not
 surprising that we did not identify USco\InsetSpace ~
66 and USco\InsetSpace ~
109 as multiples.
 Interestingly, we also found USco\InsetSpace ~
55 as a candidate for a multiple system.
 This may indicate that USco\InsetSpace ~
55 is a triple system with one of object located
 within 0.1\InsetSpace ~
au from the primary.
 In addition, we identify USco\InsetSpace ~
104 as a binary candidate, but this was not
 in their target list.
 Further they found USco\InsetSpace ~
67, 75, 112, 128, 130, 132 as non-multiple, and
 similarly we found them as 'non-candidates' for multiplicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found the RV dispersion (
\begin_inset Formula $1.2\,\kmps$
\end_inset

) of the objects in UScoOB is very similar to that of the BDs and VLM stars
 in Chamaeleon\InsetSpace ~
I (Cha\InsetSpace ~
I) previous study by 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citet{joergens:2006b}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The rotational velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset

) of the samples were also measured.
 The distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset

 for the UScoOB objects peaks around 
\begin_inset Formula $16.9\,\kmps$
\end_inset

 which is also similar to that of the Cha\InsetSpace ~
I population found by 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
citet{joergens:2006b}
\end_layout

\end_inset

; however, the dispersion of 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset

 for the UScoOB objects (
\begin_inset Formula $27.8\,\kmps$
\end_inset

) is found to be much larger than that of the Cha\InsetSpace ~
I objects (
\begin_inset Formula $8.0\,\kmps$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow-up spectroscopic observations of the binary candidates presented
 here are planned in near future.
 There are only a few RV variable binary candidates identified in earlier
 surveys (

 As

 points out most of the current RV and imaging surveys use samples from
 magnitude-limited survey, but one should attempt to use the samples from
 volume-limited survey in order to find a correct statistics on binary parameter
s more straightforwardly, i.e.
 without correcting for bias.
