==================================================================

Important points:

1) Several aspects of the analysis remain unclear, specifically with 
respect to the determination of radial velocity variations, which is 
of course the most important component of the paper. 

a) Most importantly, the precise meaning of sigma_rrv (i.e. column 5 
of table 2) is not clear. How is this different from the uncertainties 
listed directly with the radial velocity measurements in column 4? It 
is stated that sigma_rrv is "the uncertainty of RV with respect to 
the template star," but aren't the RVs in column 4 also determined 
with respect to the template star? Perhaps the authors mean to say 
that the uncertainties on the individual RVs include the uncertainty
on the template star's absolute RV, whereas the sigma_rrv values do not?
This is important for understanding the entire analysis, and must be
clarified.

 * Thank you for pointing this out. It was not clearly explained. 
   You are correct. The uncertainties listed along with RV in the 4-th
   column includes the uncertainty of the template
   absolute/heliocentric RV, but \sigma_{RRV} values  in the 5th column do
   not.  

   To clarify this I have replaced the following (in the 3rd paragraph in
   Section 3.1) 
   
   FROM:
   "The result of the heliocentric RV measurements (from two
   epochs for each object) is summarised in Table 2 along with the
   uncertainties. The table also lists the uncertainties in the
   `relative' radial velocities (\sigma_{RRV}) which is the
   uncertainty of RV with respect to the template star. "

   TO:
   "The result of the heliocentric RV measurements (from two epochs
    for each object) is summarised in Table 2 along with their
    uncertainties.  The uncertainties listed in columns~4 and 6 along
    with the absolute/heliocentric RV values include the uncertainty
    of the absolute/heliocentric RV of the template star. On the other
    hand, the uncertainties in the `relative' radial velocities
    (sigma_RRV) listed in column~5 of the table do not
    include the uncertainty of the template star. It is
    sigma_RRV that is relevant for the identification of
    RV variable objects."

   * Also in the table caption of Table 2, I added the following sentence:

      "N.B.~the uncertainties listed along with the heliocentric radial
      velocities in column~4 and 6 includes the uncertainty in the
      heliocentric RV of the template star, but \sigma_{RRV}
      in column~5 do not. "
				   



b) How was the radial-velocity template star observed, and when? I 
presume that the template was observed with the same instrument and setup
as the targets, but this should be stated explicitly if so, and
relevant observational details should be provided as well.

    * The data for the template stars and the RV standard was obtained
      at the same telescope with the same instrument setup.
      I inserted this information along with the date and S/N of these
      data at the end of Section 2. 




c) Why is the quoted uncertainty on the tested standard star so large
(0.62 km/s) compared to the typical uncertainties listed in table 2 for
the targets? I would have thought that the standard star's RV would be 
more precisely determined, as it presumably has higher S/N. I suspect
there is a simple explanation for this, but without an explanation I 
began to doubt the better precisions quoted for most of the targets.

    * The reason for the large uncertainty:
      the uncertainty quoted here is for the "heliocentric" RV
      which was computed from the error propagation using the uncertainty
      in the RV value of a template star and the uncertainty in the RV
      value of the object with respect to the template star.  Since we
      have used a few photospheric lines to determine the RV of the
      template, the uncertainty is rather large (0.4-0.5 km/s). On the
      other hand, the uncertainty in the RV with respect to the
      template star should be much smaller since it is determined by the
      cross-correlation method. 

    * Important note: 
      While I was re-checking the RV calculation for
      this RV standard (HD140538), I noticed the uncertainty in
      the RV value with respect to a template by using 
      the cross-correlation method was also rather large (0.37km/s). 
      It should not be this large as the S/N of the object was much
      higher (~60) than our main targets.
      This led me to go back to my notes, and found that I
      was using a template with a different spectral type (just for
      this object). This was another reason which contributed the
      large uncertainty. I have now recomputed the RV value of
      HD140538 (G2.5V) with more appropriate template HD74497 (G3V), 
      and the new heliocentric RV is

          RV(HD140538) = 19.17  +/- 0.40 km/s.   --- (1)
          
      This has much better agreement with the Elodie measurment of 

          RV(HD140538) = 19.00 +/- 0.05 km/s   --- (2)
      
      Note that the uncertainty in the RV of HD140538 with respect to
      the template star was very small (0.02 km/s)
      while the uncertainty is heliocentric RV of the template star is
      0.4km/s which is the dominating error in (1) above. This of
      course has no impact on the results of the paper, which are
      based on relative velocity measures.


    * I have changed the RV value for HD140538 in the text based on
      the recalculation mentioned above.  At the end of the same
      paragraph (the 2nd paragraph, Section 3.1), I now explain that
      the uncertainty in (1) is dominated by the uncertainty in the RV
      of the template star (HD74497) to avoid confusion.



d) The explanation of the accuracy of the RV measurements needs to be
improved. The entire experiment is predicated on the idea that the RV's
from the two epochs do not suffer from large systematic errors, but the
paper as written makes it very difficult for the skeptical reader to be
so reassured. In Sec 2, the authors state that autoguiding errors limit
the accuracy of the RVs to 1 km/s, but promise that their tests in Sec
3.1 of an RV standard star show the systematic error to be very small. 
However, the test in Sec 3.1 does not show this. In fact, the authors
find an RV for that star that is 0.82 km/s different from the value
published by the Elodie group. More importantly, even if the agreement
with the published value were better, a single-epoch measurement does
not by itself prove system stability. 

   * As mentioned in the response for c) above, the new RV value for
     the RV standard is 19.17  +/- 0.40 km/s.  So the agreement with
     the Elodie group is much better now.  The major source of
     error in this value is from the uncertainty in the RV
     measurement of the template star.  
   * I agree that this does not really prove "the stability" of the
     system.  


It seems to me that the authors'
claim to negligible systematic errors is really based on the claim that
the distribution of chi-squared probabilities in closely matches the 
expected distribution (Fig 2). The authors essentially end up saying
this in the paper, but obliquely in the 6th paragraph of Sec 3.1, and
more directly in the penultimate paragraph of Sec 4. This text should
be consolidated, placed sooner in the text, and the statement in Sec 2
should be modified to explicitly connect the claim of accuracy to the
chi-squared distribution.


    * In Section 2, after the sentence, "However, the autoguiding of
      the telescope keeps the star at the centre of the slit with about
      a tenth of the FWHM (1 km/s) which sets the upper limit for the
      systematic error in the RV measurements (Bailer-Jones 2004). ", 
      I have inserted the following to make the connection to the
      chi-square test shown later, 

    "As we will find out in the following section (Section 3.1), the
     systematic error may be ignored based on the result of the $\chi^{2}$
     probability analysis we performed without the introduction of
     an assumed systematic error."
   

    * I have removed the sentence, "The accuracy of the wavelength
      calibration will be demonstrated in the RV measurements of a RV
      standard in the following section" from Section 2; however, 
      the RV measurement check of the RV standard with a known value
      remain in Section 3.1.


    * The 6th-paragraph in Section 4 (starting with "In Section 3.1
      ...",  was moved to Section 3.1 with some modification as you
      suggested. This seemed to be a little out of place, as you
      pointed out. 





e) Regarding the distribution of chi-squared probabilities (Fig 2), is
the match with the expected distribution really that good? For example, 
it appears possible that the left-most bin is low compared to the 
dashed line, but this may not be significant. Can this be quantified 
statistically? 

   * I have computed the chi-square probability to test the goodness
     of the fit of the expected distribution to the histogram. I
     restricted the fit to the first four bins (from the left) of the
     histogram since the objects in the second bin from the right are
     "potentially"  RV variables (although we flagged them as the
     RV-constant).  In this analysis, we found the chi-square
     probability of ~0.5 (which is reasonable). Further if we
     re-normalized the expected distribution taking into account for
     the fact we ignored the objects in the right most two bins, the
     chi-square probability becomes ~0.9. 

     I have inserted the following paragraphs at the end of the 7-th
     paragraph in Section 3.1 to reflect this point.

     "To quantify this point, we compute the chi-square
      probability to test the goodness of the fit of the expected
      distribution to the histogram. We restrict the fit to the first
      4 bins from the left (0< -log10(p) < 2) of the histogram since the
      objects in the second bin from the right ((2.5< -log10(p)<3) are
      "potential" RV-variable, although we have flagged them as
      the RV-constant objects. In this analysis, we find the
      probability of 0.5 which indicates that the fit is
      reasonable. Further, if we re-normalized the expected
      distribution, accounting for the fact we neglected the objects
      in the second bin from the right, we find the chi-square
      probability of the fit increases to 0.9. This, in turn,
      indicates that our uncertainties in RV values are reasonable,
      and an additional systematic error may not be necessary in this
      analysis."

				   

2) Is the binary fraction determined here potentially biased (to
a higher value) by virtue of the magnitude-limited nature of the 
target selection? The authors do state that the sample is not 
complete, and in the final paragraph of the paper they state that 
volume-limited surveys are preferable. But I think the authors should 
comment explicitly (perhaps in Sec 4 or 5) in this with respect to 
their study.

   * I have added the following sentence at the end of Section~5. 
     "Finally, we note that the binary fraction found in this paper
     may be over-estimated because of the nature of our survey
     (magnitude-limited and incomplete), and because of a possible
     bias towards brighter objects." 


Minor points:

1) Explain what is meant by "variance spectra" in Sec 3.1, paragraph 3.

   * Added the following footnote on "variance spectra": 
     "Defined by the variance of the chi-square fit to the signal
      obtained during optimum extraction (c.f. Horne 1986)." 


2) 1 percent should be 0.1 percent in Sec 3.1, paragraph 5.

    * Corrected.

3) In Fig 2 caption, the statement that the dashed line is "based on
the RV uncertainties in the observations" is incorrect, I think. The
chi-squared probability distribution depends only on the number of
degrees of freedom (1 in this case), no? The vertical scaling of the
figure is then just the total number of objects, right?

    * You are absolutely right. This is my mistake. I have corrected
      the sentence 

      FROM
       "The expected distribution (dashed) for RV constant objects
        based on the RV uncertainties in the observations
	(Table~\ref{tab:summary_results}) and based on the $\chi^{2}$
	probability function is also shown for a comparison."


      TO
      "The expected distribution (dashed) for RV constant
       objects is also shown for a comparison. The distribution is
       normalized with the total number of objects that have $p<10^{-3}$."
