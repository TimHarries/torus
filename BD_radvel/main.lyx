We present the results of a radial velocity (RV) survey for 15 brown dwarfs
 (BDs) and very low-mass (VLM) stars in the Upper Scorpius OB association
 (UScoOB) and 3 BD candidates in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
Ophiuchi dark cloud core.
 We obtained high-resolution echelle spectra at VLT using Ultraviolet and
 Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at two different epochs for each object,
 and measured the shifts in their RVs to identify candidates for binary/multiple
 systems in the sample.
 We found no spectroscopic binary in our sample, based on the shape of cross-cor
elation curves.
 We found 9 out of 18 (50 per cent) in our sample show a significant RV
 change in 4--33\SpecialChar ~
d time scale, and are considered as binary/multiple `candidates.'
 The fraction slightly decreases to 43 per cent (6 out of 14) if we consider
 the objects only in the UScoOB.
 These fractions do not necessary represent that of a real binary population
 among young BDs and VLM stars since their true multiplicities are still
 to be confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic monitoring.
 Our RV-shift tests successfully detected the recently confirmed 3 binaries
 in UScoOB via high-resolution imaging technique.
 We found the RV dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is very similar to
 that of the BDs and VLM stars in Chamaeleon\SpecialChar ~
I (Cha\SpecialChar ~
I) previously studied
 by others.
 We also measured the rotational velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

) of the samples, and found good agreements with earlier studies.
 The distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

 for the UScoOB objects peaks around 
\begin_inset Formula $16.9\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

 which is also similar to that of the Cha\SpecialChar ~
I population.

Most stars are member of binary systems; hence, it is important for a star
 formation theory to be able to predict the binary fraction, period distribution
, and mass-ratio distribution of newly born stellar objects across a wide
 range mass spectrum.
 The study of the individual binary system is the only direct mean to determine
 the fundamental stellar properties such as stellar masses and radii.
 
\layout Standard

Recent high resolution imaging studies of young brown dwarfs (BDs) and very
 low-mass (VLM) stars have placed strong constraints on binaries with separation

The extensive imaging surveys provide excellent observational constraints
 on wider BD+BD binaries, but it is now necessary to search for shorter
 period BD+BD binaries systematically.
 Binaries with the separation of less than 1\SpecialChar ~
au are not resolved by current
 imaging technique, but will be detectable as spectroscopic binaries, providing
 the mass-ratio is not too extreme, and velocity separation is large enough.
 The first BD+BD spectroscopic binary, PPl\SpecialChar ~

 The binary was found to have an eccentric orbit (

 suggested that the formation process of substellar objects is biased towards
 smaller separation binaries based on the short period of PPl\SpecialChar ~

 lack of Pleiades BD binaries with separations

 who found a sevral binary candidates among them; however, the orbital parameter
s and masses of binaries remains unknown because the follow-up spectroscopic
 monitoring is lacking or still being taking places.
 In addition to the follow-up observations, the number of BDs and VLM star
 binary candidates should be increased to have a better statistics on the
 short period binary parameters.
 
\layout Standard

The separation distribution of BD/VLM binaries is critical to understanding
 their origin.
 There are two main models for the formation of BDs and VLM stars.
 First, they formed in a similar manner to higher mass stars, but from smaller-m
ass, denser molecular cloud core (e.g.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{padoan:2002}
\end_inset 

).
 Second, BD/VLM objects have low masses because they are ejected from the
 dense core in which they form via dynamical interactions in multiple system,
 cutting off their accretion before they have reached stellar masses (
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{reipurth:2001}
\end_inset 

; 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{bate:2002}
\end_inset 

).
 Alternatively, there is a third model in which a free-floating BD or planetary-
mass object can be formed in the process of the photo-evaporation 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citep{whitworth:2004}
\end_inset 

.
 The outer layers of a pre-stellar core (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.2\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset 

) removed by the strong radiation pressure from the nearby massive O and
 B stars before the accretion onto the protostar at core centre occurs.
 Apparently, this is more relevant to the high-mass star forming clouds.
 
\layout Standard

Due to the dynamical interaction involved in the second model, BD/VLM binaries
 that survive are generally expected to have small separations.
 In the first model, wider binaries may be expected to be more common.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{bate:2002}
\end_inset 

 suggested that close binaries (
\begin_inset Formula $a<10\,\mathrm{au}$
\end_inset 

) do not form directly, but result from hardening of wider systems though
 a combination of dynamical interactions, accretion and interactions with
 circum-binary discs.
 If BD/VLM binaries have formed through such mechanisms, one would expect
 to find binaries with 1--10\SpecialChar ~
au separations without also finding many with
 separation 
\begin_inset Formula $<1$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
au.
 If the absence/rarity of binaries with 1\SpecialChar ~
au were found, it would support
 the idea that they are ejected quickly from multiple systems before they
 have undergone the interactions that shorten the periods.
 
\layout Standard

Our immediate aim is to identify spectroscopic and close BD/VLM binaries
 using the high-resolution echelle spectroscopy at two epochs.
 This experiment is sensitive to VLM binaries with separations of 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.1$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
au which corresponds to a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10\,\mathrm{d}$
\end_inset 

.
 A larger sample of candidates will enable us to measure the binary fraction
 of these short-period/close binaries (once confirmed), and address whether
 there is a significant population of 'hidden' VLM companions.
 The long term goal of this project to follow up the binary candidates found
 in this paper by spectroscopically monitoring them in different time scales,
 enabling us to obtain the radial velocity curves and their minimum masses.

We obtained high resolution spectra with the Kueyen telescope of VLT (Cerro
 Parnal, Chile) using the UVES echelle spectrograph.
 The observations were carried out between April 5, 2004 and May 15, 2005
 in the service mode.
 For each object, the spectra were obtained at two different epochs separated
 by 4--33\SpecialChar ~
d to increase the chance of detectability for multiplicities.
 For each object at a given night, two separate spectra are obtained consecutive
ly.
 This will allow us to derive more reliable uncertainty estimates in the
 RV values of our targets (c.f.\SpecialChar ~

 The data was obtained using the red arm of UVES spectrograph with two mosaic

The data were reduced by the standard ESO pipeline procedures for UVES echelle
 spectra.
 In summary, the data were corrected for bias, interorder background, sky
 background, sky emission lines and cosmic ray hits.
 Further, they were flattened, optimally extracted, and finally the different
 orders were merged.
 No binning was performed to achieve high resolution required for the RV
 measurements.
 The wavelength was calibrated using the Thorium-Argon arc spectra with
 a typical value of the standard deviation of the dispersion solution of
 5\SpecialChar ~

.
 However, the autoguiding of the telescope keeps the star at the centre
 of the slit with about a tenth of the FWHM (
\begin_inset Formula $1\,\kmps$

) which sets the upper limit for the systematic error in the RV measurements

 The accuracy of the wavelength calibration will be demonstrated in the
 RV measurements of a RV standard in the following section.
 A typical signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per wavelength bin of the spectra
 is about 15, and the heliocentric velocity correction was applied to the
 final spectra.

The radial velocities of each object are determined by using the cross-correlati
on function of object spectra with that of a template star which has a spectra
 type similar to those of our objects.
 By visual inspections, the wavelength ranges used for the cross-correlation
 calculations are chosen by avoiding the regions of spectra affected by
 the telluric lines, the defects and the fringes (in near infrared) of CCDs,
 The radial velocities of objects with respect to the template are obtained
 by measuring the location of the peak in the cross-correlation function
 which is fitted by the combination of two gaussian functions sharing their
 centres and a constant term.
 LHS\SpecialChar ~
49 (Proxima Cen, M5.5) is chosen as the template for this purpose.
 The radial velocity of the template object LHS\SpecialChar ~
49 was obtained by measuring
 the wavelength shifts of the prominent photospheric absorption features

 The heliocentric RV of each object can be then calculated by adding

 with the RV of each object with respect to LHS\SpecialChar ~

 In the following measurements of the heliocentric radial velocities, our

) will be used for a consistency.

Before applying the cross-correlation technique to out main targets, we

 This was done so to ensure not only the validity of the cross-correlation

 In this test, we found the heliocentric 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{RV_{HD\,140538}=}18.8\pm0.6\,\kmps$

The result of the heliocentric RV measurements (from two epochs for each
 object) is summarised in Table\SpecialChar ~

 along with the uncertainties.
 The table also lists the uncertainties in the `relative' radial velocities
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset 

) which is the uncertainties of RVs with respect to the template star.
 The two consecutive measurements of RVs (from same nights) are used to
 find the RV of the night, and their uncertainties are obtained from the
 standard deviations of the mean (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset 

) and the uncertainty of the template RV value (c.f.\SpecialChar ~

).
 The 'average' radial velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mathrm{RV}}$
\end_inset 

) of the two epochs are also given in the same table for a reference.
 The

 in Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:literatures}

, except for the values for USco\SpecialChar ~
66 and USco\SpecialChar ~
75.
 This difference is not surprising since the former is a known binary 
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

citep{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 and the latter is a non-constant RV object (a candidate for a multiple)
 found in the RV-shift test which will be discussed next.
 
\layout Standard

For each object and for each RV measurement, the deviations (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathrm{RV}$
\end_inset 

) from the average RV are computed and summaries in Fig.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:radvel01}

\end_inset 

 along with their uncertainties (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset 

) in order to aid the identifications of multiplicity candidates.
 Note that in computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathrm{RV}$
\end_inset 

 we do not require the knowledge of absolute or the heliocentric radial
 velocities, but only the relative velecities (with respect to a template).
 We choose a object as a candidate when the 1
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{RRV}}$
\end_inset 

 error bar from each RV measurement overlaps one another.
 Using this simple criteria, the candidate were selected and indicated in
 the same table (Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:summary_results}

\end_inset 

).
 We found 9 out of 18 (50 per cent of) our sample are considered as candidates.
 The recent observation of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 (which was not known to authors at the time of our observation: April--May,
 2004) confirms that USco\SpecialChar ~
65 and USco\SpecialChar ~
66 are multiple systems, and USco\SpecialChar ~
109
 is most likely a multiple system.
 In our RV-shift tests, we found all the multiples confirmed by 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 in our multiple candidates.
 Further they found USco\SpecialChar ~
67, 128, 130, 132 as non-multiple, and similarly
 we found them as 'non-candidates' for multiplicity.
 The discrepancy between their results and ours are only in USco\SpecialChar ~
75 and USco\SpecialChar ~
112.
 While our results suggests that these are candidates for multiple systems,
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 did not find them as multiple systems.
 This difference may be caused by the difference in sensitivity (on a binary
 separation) of the two different methods.
 Another possible caused of the difference is that the uncertainties in
 RVs may be underestimated.
 The surface activities of the objects may also contribute noise in the
 RV measuements; however, the levels of th noise is expeted be small for
 BD and VLM stars (c.f.\SpecialChar ~

Finally, the histogram of the RVs using only the objects in UScoOB is given
 in Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:vrad_vrot_histrogram}

\end_inset 

.
 The total number of the objects is 14.
 Note that USco\SpecialChar ~
121 is excluded from the graph since it is identified as
 a non-member of the UScoOB association based on the RV value (see Table\SpecialChar ~

 also found it to be a likely non-member based on the radial velocity and
 the low lithium abundance.
 The distribution of the RVs in the figure was fitted by a gaussian function.
 We found that the standard deviation and the peak position of the radial
 velocity distribution are 
\begin_inset Formula $1.2\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-5.9\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

 respectively.
 The former is very similar to the standard deviation (0.9\SpecialChar ~

 They also studied the radial velocity distribution of more massive 25 T\SpecialChar ~

 stars in Cha\SpecialChar ~

) is not significantly different from that of the brown dwarfs and the very
 low-mass objects.
 Unfortunately, we do not have the radial velocity measurements of the higher
 mass counter parts (T\SpecialChar ~

 This is also planned for a near future investigation as this is important
 for the study of the mass dependency of the kinematics in a young stellar
 cluster.

The rotational velocities of the objects are determined by measuring the
 widths of the cross correlation curves of the target spectra against a
 templates spectra from an object which is known to have a very small rotational
 velocity.
 The line broadening of the targets are assumed to be dominated by rotational
 broadening.
 As in the cases for the radial velocity measurements, LHS\SpecialChar ~
49 is chosen for
 the template.
 Using its known period (
\begin_inset Formula $P\approx83\,\mathrm{d}$

 from the VLTI measurement by 
\begin_inset ERT

49 is estimated as 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i=2\pi R_{*}/P\approx0.1\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

; hence, negligibly small.
 
\layout Standard

The width of the cross-correlation curves (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mathrm{CCF}}$
\end_inset 

) are calibrated with the rotational velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

) by cross correlating the template spectra against the same template spectra
 with added rotation (convolved with a given

), as similarly done by e.g.\SpecialChar ~

 For each object, two measurements of rotational velocities are computed
 from two independent spectra obtained at different epochs.
 As similary done for the RV measurements, the mean and the standard deviation
 of the mean are used as the final rotational velocity and its uncertainty.
 The final results are placed in Table\SpecialChar ~

 fit, we find the 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

 distribution of the BD and VLM stars (8 objects) in Cha\SpecialChar ~
I peaks at 
\begin_inset Formula $15.4\,\kmps$

\end_inset 

.
 The peak of the distribution is similar to that of Upper Sco objects, but
 the standard deviation of the distribution is significantly smaller than
 that of the Upper Sco objects.
 The difference maybe due to the very small number of samples.
 A similar fit was applied to the

According to Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:summary_results}

\end_inset 

, 9 out of 18 (50 per cent of) samples are considered as binary/multiple
 candidates.
 The fraction slightly decreases to 43 per cent (6 out of 14) if we consider
 the objects only in the UScoOB.
 These fractions are significantly larger than the binary fraction (25\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent,
 3 out of 12) found by the recent high-resolution imaging survey of brown
 dwarfs and very low-mass objects (M5.5--M7.5 ) in the UScoOB 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

citep{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

.
 The imaging surveys are sensitive to wider binaries (separation
\begin_inset Formula $\gtrsim4\,\mathrm{au}$
\end_inset 

) while our technique is more sensitive to narrower (
\begin_inset Formula $\lesssim1\,\mathrm{au}$
\end_inset 

) or shorter period (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10\,\mathrm{d}$
\end_inset 

) binaries.
 However, our RV-shift test also detected all the binaries found in the
 imaging survey of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

, demonstrating that the method is also effective in the systems with a
 separation 5--18\SpecialChar ~
au.
 In Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Radial-velocities}

\end_inset 

, we have found all the binaries confirmed by 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 also as our binary/multiple candidates.
 In addition to those samples commonly found, we have two more candidates
 (USco\SpecialChar ~
75 and USco\SpecialChar ~
112) which are in the sample of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

, but not detected as binaries by them.
 If we assume these objects are real binary/multiple systems but not detected
 by the imaging survey because of possibly very small separations, their
 multiplicity fraction would increase to 5 out of 9 (56\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) which is
 more consistent with the fraction suggested by our RV survey.
\layout Standard

Another possible reason for the different binary fraction suggested by our
 data is that the uncertainties in the RV values may be underestimated.
 Since the our suggested binary fraction is merely that for the binary `candidat
es', the follow-up RV monitoring of the candidates must be done to confirm
 the true multiplicity, and to determined firmer constraint on the binary/multip
le faction in the UScoOB.
 This is planned for a near future.
 The binary fraction of slightly more massive pre-main-sequence stars was
 studied by 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kohler:2000}
\end_inset 

 using the K-band speckle interferometry of X-ray selected samples.
 For the UScoOB members with spectral type M0--M5 (0.7--0.13\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset 

), they found the binary fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $52\left(\pm10\right)$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent (26 out of 50) with the separation 21--1000\SpecialChar ~
au.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kohler:2000}
\end_inset 

 found no wide (
\begin_inset Formula $>20\,\mathrm{au}$
\end_inset 

) binary in their survey, and suggested that there may be a discontinuity
 in separation distribution around 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{*}\sim0.1\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset 

.

 using 12 objects (Cha\SpecialChar ~

 found only 11\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent (1 out of 9) of the sample showed non-constant RVs
 in her multi-epoch data, indicating a much smaller multiplicity fraction.
 It is unclear at this moment whether the difference is caused by the physical
 nature of the two different star forming regions.

We have presented two-epoch RV survey of 18 young BDs and VLM stars in UScoOB
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

\SpecialChar ~
Oph dark cloud core using the high resolution UVES echelle spectroscopy
 at VLT.
 The amount of the shifts in RVs in time is used to identify the candidates
 for multiplicity.
 
\layout Standard

We found 9 out of 18 objects (50\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) are possible candidates in this
 analysis.
 For the objects in UScoOB, we found 6 out of 14 objects (43\SpecialChar ~
per\SpecialChar ~
cent) as
 candidates.
 Compared to the average binary fraction (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim20\,\mathrm{per\, cent}$
\end_inset 

) of magnitude-limited imaging surveys for BDs and VLM stars (M6 and later)
 in the field (c.f.\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citealt{burgasser:2006}
\end_inset 

), the fraction of the binary `candidates' found by this RV survey is significan
tly higher.
 The possible reasons to for the discrepancy are: (1) caused by the different
 sensitivity on the binary separation in the imaging and RV technique, (2)
 caused by possibly under estimated uncertainties in the measured RV values.
 The true multiplicity of the candidates must be confirmed by follow-up
 spectroscopy monitoring of candidates.
 
\layout Standard

We found a good agreement with the high resolution imaging survey of the
 BD and VLM objects in UScoOB of 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

.
 All three confirmed binaries in UScoOB by 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
citet{kraus:2005}
\end_inset 

 are found as the multiplicity candidate this RV survey; however, we found
 two objects (USco\SpecialChar ~
75 and USco\SpecialChar ~
112) also as binary candidates while they found
 them as singles.
\layout Standard

From the distribution of RV values in UScoOB, we confirmed that USco\SpecialChar ~
121
 is most likely a non-member of the association, as similarly found so by
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard
 
\backslash 
citet{muzerolle:2003}
\end_inset 

.
 We found the RV dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is very similar to
 that of the BDs and VLM stars in Chamaeleon\SpecialChar ~
I (Cha\SpecialChar ~
I) previously studied
 by others.
 The rotational velocities (
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

) of the samples are also measured.
 The distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $v\,\sin i$
\end_inset 

 for the UScoOB objects peaks around 
\begin_inset Formula $16.9\,\kmps$
\end_inset 

 which is similar to that of the Cha\SpecialChar ~
I population.
 
\layout Standard

The follow-up spectroscopic observations of the binary candidates presented
 here are planned in near future.
 There are only a few RV variable binary candidates are identified from
 the earlier surveys (

 As 
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

citet{burgasser:2006}
\end_inset 

 pointed out most of the current RV and imaging surveys use samples from
 magnitude-limited survey, but one should attempt to use the samples from
 volume-limited survey in order to find a correct statistics on binary parameter
s more straight forwardly, i.e.
 without correcting for bias.
